Description Maze v1.0@*
@*
The application provides a graphical Maze with support for the following features:@*
Selecting a tab with a subroutine: caves, or labyrinth.@*
I)In the cave tab:@*
Data source mode selection:@*
1)Generate a random cave with a selectable number of rows and columns, with a chance of a filled cell appearing.@*
2)Or load data from a file, the file should look like:@*
4 4@*
0 1 0 1@*
1 0 0 1@*
0 1 0 0@*
0 0 1 1@*
Where is the number of rows and columns,@*
as well as a matrix containing the position of "live" and "dead" cells.@*
@*
3)Setting the values of life and death variables.@*
@*
Respawn mode selection:@*
automatic, with speed selection.@*
Or rebirth mode step by step.@*
@*
4)Drawing according to the logic of the algorithm, first the entire field is filled randomly with walls - i.e. for each cell is randomly determined,@*
whether it will be free or impassable - and then the state of the map is updated several times in accordance with the conditions.@*
@*
5)Clearing the render screen and ui elements.@*
@*
II)In the maze tab:@*
Data source mode selection: @*
1)Generate a random maze with a selectable number of rows and columns.@*
2)Or load data from a file, the file should look like:@*
4 4@*
0 0 0 1@*

@*
1 0 1 0@*
0 0 1 0@*
1 1 0 1@*
1 1 1 1@*
Where there is a number of rows and columns, and two matrices containing the position of vertical and horizontal walls.@*
@*
3)Drawing according to the logic of the algorithm, a labyrinth with "thin walls" is a table of n rows by m columns.@*
There can be "walls" between table cells. Also, "walls" surround the entire table as a whole. The maze is generated without isolated areas and loops.@*
@*
4)Finding the shortest path in a maze from point to point.@*
@*
5)Clearing the render screen and ui elements.@*
6)Saving the rendered maze to file.@*
@*
@*
